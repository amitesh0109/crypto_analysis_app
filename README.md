I've created a Python script that analyzes cryptocurrency data and displays the results in a Streamlit web app. This project demonstrates several key skills for a data analyst job application:

Data retrieval: Using the yfinance library to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.
Data analysis: Calculating moving averages, daily returns, and volatility.
Data visualization: Creating interactive charts using Plotly Express.
Web app development: Building an interactive dashboard with Streamlit.
